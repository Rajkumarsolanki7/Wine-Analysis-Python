# Wine-Analysis-Python

Objective:-
The objective of this project is to analyze a wine quality dataset to understand factors influencing wine quality. This includes data inspection, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize distributions and relationships, and outlier detection using interquartile range (IQR) analysis. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that explain the attributes contributing to wine quality ratings.

Tools Used:-
Libraries:

1.numpy

2.pandas

3.matplotlib

4.seaborn

5.IPython.display

Methods:

1.Data Loading: pandas.read_csv()

2.Data Inspection: head(), info(), describe(), isnull()

3.Visualization: Scatter plots, heatmaps, joint plots

4.Outlier Detection: Interquartile range (IQR) analysis
